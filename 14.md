us a guide book to London a hundred years ago to look at.

Among the coins he brought was one of silver of Queen Elizabeth

made so old and ugly that she ordered them all destroyed, about

a third of this has been cut off, but the head is left entire. This

is the only one know[sic] to exist. The British Museum offered him

60[GBP] for it which he declined but has left it to the museum

in his will. After he left us I bought this book etc. Miss Cary

made us a very agreeable visit in the evening. She told

us that it has been quite the fashion this summer to pack[?]

in the brougham to the Foreing Office, a superb new building
