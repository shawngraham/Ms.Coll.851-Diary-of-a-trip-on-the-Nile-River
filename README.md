transcribing Ms. Coll. 851 - Diary of a trip on the Nile River

Source http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_5103295

An experiment in using Github to transcribe historical texts. S. Graham. Fork and improve the transcription. One markdown document per original diary page. End lines to match the original text. Text begins on page 6 in the Penn Libraries online viewer.

I'm using [prose.io] to do my editing. I have the image of the text open in one window, prose.io tied into this repository in the other.
